## Project Description
The project aims at predicting student performance using various factors such as attendance and study hours. 
This project analyzes student performance using a dataset containing various demographic and educational attributes. The goal is to explore relationships between features like gender, parental education level, and test preparation on students' scores in math, reading, and writing.
Key features include:
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory data analysis using visualizations
Correlation analysis
Linear regression model to predict math scores

## How to Run
